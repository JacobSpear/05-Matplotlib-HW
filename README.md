The data show the impacts of four treatments on a number of measures of health in mice with cancerous tumors.  This analysis compares the effectiveness of Capomulin, Infubinol, and Ketapril with that of a Placebo in treating tumors in mice.  Visualization of the data suggests the following possible trends:

1. Capomulin was the only drug which showed a decrease in average tumor size over the course of the treatment period, with tumors in mice treated with Capomulin decreasing by over 19%, compared with a more than 50% increase in tumors in the placebo group.

2. Mice treated with Capomulin had the higest survival rate of the four treatments, with more than 80% of mice treated with Capomulin surviving the trial, as opposed to under 40% of mice treated with Infubinol (the treatment with the lowest survival rate).

3. We can see from the scatterplots of metastatic site counts with markers of variable sizes that Capomulin was the only drug for which the mode of metastatic site count on the final day of the study was less than 3.
